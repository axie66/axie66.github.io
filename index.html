    Hello there! I'm a 1st year MLT student at 
    <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon's</a> 
    <a href='https://www.lti.cmu.edu/'>Language Technologies Institute</a>,
    where I'm fortunate to be co-advised by 
    <a href='https://dpfried.github.io/'>Daniel Fried</a>, 
    <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/'>Matt Gormley</a>,
    and 
    <a href='http://vhellendoorn.github.io/'>Vincent Hellendoorn</a>.
</p>

    I'm broadly interested in NLP for code, though I've recently been thinking
    about bringing interactivity into code generation. Code generation, like many
    NLP tasks, is usually posed as a problem of mapping an input
    to an output in a single turn of interaction. But in an era of LLMs 
    and chatbots, is this still the best framing of the task?

    Outside of code, I'm also interested in natural language generation â€“ specifically, 
    in what methods from the past can (and cannot) teach us about how to decode 
    with today's models.

    Before this, I did my undergrad also at CMU in computer science with a 
    concentration in machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy playing and 
    watching soccer. <span style="font-size: 6px">please dear god let Tottenham win something this season :')</span>
