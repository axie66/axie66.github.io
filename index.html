<p>
    Hello there! I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science
    with a concentration in Machine Learning.

    My research interests lie in natural language processing, machine learning, 
    and deep learning. More specifically, I'm interested in harnessing ML and NLP
    for software engineering, particularly for programming language understanding & generation.
